                        <h5 class="response"> The central question of the piece, "What is Mail Art"—and by extension
                            "What is Art"—forced me to consider the elements that constitute it. When thinking about a
                            piece of art, both medium and support are typically considered essential to creating the
                            piece. However, changing the support (e.g., the postage system vs relying upon friends) does
                            not remove the artist's intention of making his creation. Thinking about the mail artist's
                            intention of choosing his support, I realized that the most jarring difference between mail
                            art, from art as we mentally conceptualize it, is in its size and complexity, leading me to
                            wonder: is the enigmatic "Big Monster" Carrión refers to in his writing meant to be taken
                            literally? I.e., "Mail Art knocks at the door of the castle where the Big Monster lives"
                            conveys that mail art is a direct and intentional opposition to the notion that art should
                            be Big and grand as we often see in museums. Further, can a work that is not big (or
                            categorized under the "Fine Arts") then be considered art? </h5>

                        <h5 class="response"> The idea that a website could be incomplete was initially hard for me to
                            conceive as before reading this piece, my concept of a website aligned with what users
                            typically see on Instagram's, Google's, etc. interfaces. However as Schwulst implores
                            readers to create their own spaces on the web, I began to understand the web in terms of its
                            meaning to people who use it rather than the financial purposes behind social media
                            platforms. As people consume information, much of it becomes integrated into their
                            understanding of the world, and hence a part of one's identity. Then is a website, a
                            reflection of one's specially crafted space on the web and a part of their identity, able to
                            fully reflect reality? Does the dimensionality or format of the web limit us in
                            self-expression? </h5>

                            to think about. It is a pity that so many website creators put in a great deal of effort
                            into their work, but the continual evolution of the web have let projects be put on halt or
                            lost. It is also interesting how the reading concluded that age has no value, as the
                            development of a website is not linear. Given that our projects could be involuntarily shut
                            down with the constant changes on the web, does the uncertainty for preservation of
                            web-related projects increase the value of it? </h5>

                        <h5 class="response"> After reading the text, I realized that alt-text is intrinsically useful
                            for individuals who do not interact with the web in typical ways. It allows accessibility of
                            web functions across different needs. Moreover, it can be seen as self-expression by the
                            author as he/she has the freedom to write the alt-text how they see fit. I had a similar
                            question to the one raised in the reading on whether alt-text should be written objectively
                            or subjectively. Ultimately I feel that navigating websites itself is a subjective process,
                            as they are often a result of curated flows by their designer. Hence, introducing
                            subjectivity into alt-text may end up enriching the experience of browsing a website for
                            those who need it. </h5>

                        <h5 class="response"> After finishing this reading, it was interesting to realize that code is
                            often language-specific. More likely than not, the programming language is built around
                            English, rendering non-speakers unable to learn this skill. As the author points out, it is
                            difficult to adapt alternative versions of the coding language to suit a non-English user
                            due to flaws in the premise of programming. However, it is still necessary for us to create
                            opportunities and spaces for such sections of society in the digital space. The author
                            proposes, at the end of his paper, to create a new inclusive language from scratch, which
                            makes me wonder if such a feat is possible at all. How can we merge different
                            culture-specific linguistic patterns of languages to unify programming? What sort of losses
                            in nuances will arise from such a move? </h5>

                            In a day and age where we are highly reliant on the Internet, hyperlinks are a
                            quintessential part of our online experience. Hyperlinks can be used as a creative tool to
                            disrupt linear narratives and encourage audience participation. How, then, can we leverage
                            this existing network to bring about novel experiences on our sites? Further, must we
                            necessarily use hyperlinks in our design, given how crowded/cognitively demanding the online
                            space is today.</h5>

                            personal experiences or cultural background may have influenced her artistic exploration of
                            absence. Additionally, I'm curious about the reception of "String Games" among different

                            artists where Groys highlights the Internet's role in challenging traditional notions of
                            authorship, ownership, and distribution in art. He argues that the internet challenges
                            traditional notions of authorship by enabling collaborative and participatory forms of
                            creation. Additionally, Groys discusses how digital art complicates issues of ownership and
                            authenticity, raising questions about the commodification of art in the digital age.
                            Overall, his nuanced exploration highlights both the opportunities and challenges presented
                            by the internet for the creation, dissemination, and reception of art. This leads me to my
                            question in response to his mention of the copy and paste: while the action encourages
                            participatory behavior and lowers the barriers to being involved in art, when should we draw
                            the line between art and users' thoughtless use of such a simplified means of disseminating
                            art? How can creators prevent such abuse of their works online? </h5>

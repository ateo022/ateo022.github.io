        <h1> Guess What You Drew </h1>
        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Every student in this class should raise their hands now to choose a unique letter from A to I (without
                any overlaps). These letters will correspond to drawing instructions for each student in the activity.
                If there are any students who are absent, Grey will stand in to complete the instructions for the
                respective unclaimed letters, where appropriate. </li>
            <li> Notes on drawing: </br>
                — On the jspaint page on Chrome, bring your cursor to the white canvas on the screen. All drawings
                henceforth should be made within this space using the cursor. </li>
            — For all following instructions starting with the word "draw." To draw, either press or click the trackpad
            or mouse, respectively, with your right index finger. Without letting go, drag the cursor using the trackpad
            or mouse to draw your desired line as instructed. </br>
            — Any mistake made by the actor can be corrected by press "command" and "z" together on the keyboard.
            However, take note to rectify mistakes by re-executing the relevant instructions at the step where the
            mistake was made. </li>
            <li>Step up to the teaching computer by the door when the instruction lists the letter you chose in Step 1
                to execute the task during your turn.</li>
            <li>Student A: Near the top of the canvas, draw a line with 2 gentle and smooth bumps slanting upwards that
                takes up no more than 20% of the canvas. </li>
            <li>Student B: At the rightmost point of the drawn line, continue the shape. Draw a vertical oval with the
                short side that only extends as far down as the right most point of the line drawn in Step 4. Leave the
                oval open, without connecting the start and end points, at approximately 90% completion. </li>
            <li>Student C: Shade the oval in Step 5 by drawing a continuous line, till the oval is darkened. </li>
            <li>Student D: Draw a very small line that resembles an exponential curve flipped along the y=x axis,
                starting near the bottom left corner of the oval drawn in Step 5. </li>
            <li>Student E: From the left most point of the line drawn in Step 4, draw a gentle curve that mirrors the
                direction and approaches the line drawn in Step 7. </li>
            <li>Student F: At the leftmost point from which the line in Step 4 was drawn, draw a small circle, about 5%
                the size of the existing drawing, along the left side of the sloped line. </li>
            <li>Student G: Shade the small circle in Step 7 by drawing a continious line, till the circle is darkened.
            </li>
            <li>Student H: Draw a small exponential curve upwards slightly before the downward slope of the line drawn
                in Step 8. Change the pen to a bigger stroke size on Paint.JS and draw a dot directly above the line in
                Step 9, placed at the upper third of the drawing. </li>
            <li>Student I: Using the same thick brush stroke in 11, draw a short downward slanting like that connects
                the vertical portions of the lines drawn in Steps 7 and 8 </li>
            <li>Guess what the class was drawing.</li>

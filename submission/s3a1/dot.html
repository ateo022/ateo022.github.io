        <h1> Guess What You Drew </h1>
        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Hi Grey, please read out the following instructions in the listed order. For every instruction, read
                the next instruction once the current one is complete. </li>
            <li> Every student in this class should raise their hand now to choose a unique letter from A to I (without
                any overlaps). These letters will correspond to drawing instructions for each student in the activity.
                If there are any students who are absent, Grey will stand in to complete the instructions for the
                respective unclaimed letters, where appropriate. </li>
            <li> Notes on drawing: </br>
                — On the jspaint page on Chrome, bring your cursor to the white canvas on the screen. All drawings
                henceforth should be made within this space. </li>
            — For all following instructions starting with the word "draw," draw by holding down on the top left corner
            of the mouse using your right index finger. Without letting go, drag the mouse to direct the cursor on
            screen to draw your desired line as instructed. </br>
            — Any mistake made by the actor can be corrected by press "command" and "z" together on the keyboard.
            However, take note to rectify mistakes by re-executing the relevant instructions at the step where the
            mistake was made. </li>
            <li>Return to the instruction page to scroll upwards if the next instruction is not visible at any point.
                Return to the drawing page once done. </li>
            <li>For the following, the letter you chose in Step 2 dictates the alphabetical order in which you participate. When it is your turn, step up
                to the teaching computer by the door to execute the instruction that corresponds to
                your chosen letter as denoted by 'Student: "X,"' with 'X' being the alphabet you chose. Return to your seat when you are done with the task. </li>
            <li>Student A: Near the top of the canvas, draw a line with 2 gentle and smooth bumps slanting upwards that
                takes up no more than 20% of the canvas. </li>
            <li>Student B: At the rightmost point of the drawn line, continue the shape. Draw a vertical oval with a
                short side that only extends as far down as the right most point of the line drawn in Step 6. Leave the
                oval open, without connecting the start and end points, at approximately 90% completion. </li>
            <li>Student C: Shade the oval in Step 7 by drawing a continuous line within the boundary of the oval, till the oval is darkened. </li>
            <li>Student D: Draw a very small line that resembles an exponential curve flipped along the y=x axis,
                starting near the bottom left corner of the oval drawn in Step 7. </li>
            <li>Student E: From the left most point of the line drawn in Step 6, draw a gentle curve that mirrors the
                direction and approaches the line drawn in Step 7. </li>
            <li>Student F: At the leftmost point from which the line in Step 6 was drawn, draw a small circle, about 5%
                the size of the existing drawing, along the left side of the sloped line. </li>
            <li>Student G: Shade the small circle in Step 11 by drawing a continious line within the boundary, till the circle is darkened.
            </li>
            <li>Student H: Draw a small exponential curve upwards slightly before the line drawn
                in Step 10 begins to slope downwards. Draw a large dot, of about the size of an ant, vertically above the line in
                Step 9, placed within the upper third of the current drawing. </li>
            <li>Student I: Draw a thin downward slanting rectangle that connects
                the vertical portions of the lines drawn in Steps 7 and 8 </li>
            <li>Student J: Guess what the class just drew.</li>
